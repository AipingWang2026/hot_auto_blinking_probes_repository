**Custom Analysis Scripts for Single-Molecule and Super-Resolution Microscopy**

This repository contains the custom analysis scripts developed and used in our study, as described in "HoT Auto-Blinking Probes Enable Real-Time, Super-Resolution Chromatin Imaging in Live Cells and Tissues", submitted to *Molecular Cell*. The code supports data processing and quantitative analysis for various advanced microscopy techniques, including:

- **MINFLUX data analysis**
- **ONI data analysis**
- **Single-molecule photophysical properties**
- **Vutara data analysis**
- **Voronoi analysis**
- **Radius of Gyration**

All scripts are provided as-is and are intended to facilitate reproducibility. Detailed usage instructions and dependencies are provided in the README in each directory.

**Note:**  
Voronoi analysis and radius of gyration routines were adapted from Neguembor et al., *Molecular Cell* (2021).
